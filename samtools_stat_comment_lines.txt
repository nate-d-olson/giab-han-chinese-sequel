# This file was produced by samtools stats (1.9+htslib-1.9) and can be plotted using plot-bamstats
# This file contains statistics for all reads.
# The command line was:  stats -r hs37d5.fa.gz data/HG006_PacBio_GRCh37.bam
# CHK, Checksum	[2]Read Names	[3]Sequences	[4]Qualities
# CHK, CRC32 of reads which passed filtering followed by addition (32bit overflow)
# Summary Numbers. Use `grep ^SN | cut -f 2-` to extract this part.
# First Fragment Qualities. Use `grep ^FFQ | cut -f 2-` to extract this part.
# Columns correspond to qualities and rows to cycles. First column is the cycle number.
# Last Fragment Qualities. Use `grep ^LFQ | cut -f 2-` to extract this part.
# Columns correspond to qualities and rows to cycles. First column is the cycle number.
# Mismatches per cycle and quality. Use `grep ^MPC | cut -f 2-` to extract this part.
# Columns correspond to qualities, rows to cycles. First column is the cycle number, second
# is the number of N's and the rest is the number of mismatches
# GC Content of first fragments. Use `grep ^GCF | cut -f 2-` to extract this part.
# GC Content of last fragments. Use `grep ^GCL | cut -f 2-` to extract this part.
# ACGT content per cycle. Use `grep ^GCC | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: cycle; A,C,G,T base counts as a percentage of all A/C/G/T bases [%]; and N and O counts as a percentage of all A/C/G/T bases [%]
# ACGT content per cycle for first fragments. Use `grep ^FBC | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: cycle; A,C,G,T base counts as a percentage of all A/C/G/T bases [%]; and N and O counts as a percentage of all A/C/G/T bases [%]
# ACGT content per cycle for last fragments. Use `grep ^LBC | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: cycle; A,C,G,T base counts as a percentage of all A/C/G/T bases [%]; and N and O counts as a percentage of all A/C/G/T bases [%]
# Insert sizes. Use `grep ^IS | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: insert size, pairs total, inward oriented pairs, outward oriented pairs, other pairs
# Read lengths. Use `grep ^RL | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: read length, count
# Read lengths - first fragments. Use `grep ^FRL | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: read length, count
# Read lengths - last fragments. Use `grep ^LRL | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: read length, count
# Indel distribution. Use `grep ^ID | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: length, number of insertions, number of deletions
# Indels per cycle. Use `grep ^IC | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: cycle, number of insertions (fwd), .. (rev) , number of deletions (fwd), .. (rev)
# Coverage distribution. Use `grep ^COV | cut -f 2-` to extract this part.
# GC-depth. Use `grep ^GCD | cut -f 2-` to extract this part. The columns are: GC%, unique sequence percentiles, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th depth percentile
